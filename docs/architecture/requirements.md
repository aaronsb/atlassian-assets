# Requirements - Atlassian Assets CLI Toolkit

## User Stories

### req-001: MCP Agent Interface for Asset Management
**As a** developer building AI agents  
**I want** an MCP interface to manage Atlassian Assets via CRUD operations  
**So that** AI agents can integrate asset management into automated workflows

#### Acceptance Criteria
- When agents call MCP tools, then they shall be able to create, read, update, and delete assets
- When operations complete, then agents shall receive structured response data
- When errors occur, then agents shall receive actionable error information
- When the interface is designed, then it shall parallel good CLI design patterns

### req-002: CLI Prototype Implementation
**As a** developer  
**I want** to prototype asset management functionality as a CLI first  
**So that** I can validate the design patterns before building the MCP interface

#### Acceptance Criteria
- When I run CLI commands, then I shall be able to create, read, update, and delete assets
- When CLI design is complete, then it shall translate naturally to MCP tool structure
- When operations complete, then I shall receive clear feedback on success/failure
- When the CLI works, then it shall serve as a foundation for MCP implementation

### req-003: SDK Integration Research
**As a** developer  
**I want** to identify suitable open-source Atlassian Assets SDK libraries  
**So that** I can build the CLI toolkit on reliable foundations

#### Acceptance Criteria
- When researching SDKs, then I shall evaluate open-source options first
- When selecting an SDK, then it shall support Assets API operations
- When documenting findings, then I shall include pros/cons of each option
- When making recommendations, then I shall prioritize maintainability and community support
