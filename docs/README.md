## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **New to the project?** Start with the [main README](../README.md) for quick setup
2. **Want to see it in action?** Check out the [Claude Desktop Schema Creation](./use-cases/claude-desktop-schema-creation.md) use case
3. **Setting up automation?** Follow the [MCP Integration Guide](./guides/mcp-integration-guide.md)
4. **Need CLI examples?** Explore [CLI Automation Workflows](./use-cases/cli-automation-workflows.md)
5. **Planning production deployment?** Review [MCP Deployment Patterns](./architecture/mcp-deployment-patterns.md)

## üé® Key Differentiators

This project provides unique capabilities beyond traditional asset management tools:

### **Conversational Asset Management**
- AI agents create complex schemas through natural language conversation
- Transform workshop discussions into production-ready asset structures
- Real-time schema creation with intelligent validation and suggestions

### **Schema Introspection & Analysis**
- Analyze schema complexity and structure beyond Atlassian's built-in tools
- Compare schemas across environments
- Generate migration scripts and templates
- Provide optimization recommendations

### **Template-Driven Consultancy**
- Industry-specific templates for rapid deployment
- Client customization capabilities
- Reusable schema patterns for common use cases
- Cross-environment migration tools

### **Dual Interface Architecture**
- CLI for human operators and traditional automation
- MCP server for AI agents and modern automation platforms
- Shared codebase ensuring consistency across interfaces
- Flexible deployment patterns (local, HTTP, hosted)
