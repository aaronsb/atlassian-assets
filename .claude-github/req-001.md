# req-001: MCP Agent Interface for Asset Management

**As a** developer building AI agents  
**I want** an MCP interface to manage Atlassian Assets via CRUD operations  
**So that** AI agents can integrate asset management into automated workflows

## Acceptance Criteria
- When agents call MCP tools, then they shall be able to create, read, update, and delete assets
- When operations complete, then agents shall receive structured response data
- When errors occur, then agents shall receive actionable error information
- When the interface is designed, then it shall parallel good CLI design patterns

## Status
âœ… **COMPLETED** - Full MCP server implementation with 13 tools complete

## Implementation Details
- 13 MCP tools implemented with AI-specific guidance
- All CRUD operations functional
- Error handling with recovery suggestions
- Parameter validation and structured responses
- Dual workflow support (CLI + MCP)
