# req-002: CLI Prototype Implementation

**As a** developer  
**I want** to prototype asset management functionality as a CLI first  
**So that** I can validate the design patterns before building the MCP interface

## Acceptance Criteria
- When I run CLI commands, then I shall be able to create, read, update, and delete assets
- When CLI design is complete, then it shall translate naturally to MCP tool structure
- When operations complete, then I shall receive clear feedback on success/failure
- When the CLI works, then it shall serve as a foundation for MCP implementation

## Status
âœ… **COMPLETED** - CLI prototype serves as foundation for MCP implementation

## Implementation Details
- Complete CLI framework with 24+ specialized commands
- All CRUD operations functional
- Contextual hints and intelligent workflows
- Natural translation to MCP tool structure
- Shared common package for code reuse
