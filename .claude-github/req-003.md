# req-003: SDK Integration Research

**As a** developer  
**I want** to identify suitable open-source Atlassian Assets SDK libraries  
**So that** I can build the CLI toolkit on reliable foundations

## Acceptance Criteria
- When researching SDKs, then I shall evaluate open-source options first
- When selecting an SDK, then it shall support Assets API operations
- When documenting findings, then I shall include pros/cons of each option
- When making recommendations, then I shall prioritize maintainability and community support

## Status
âœ… **COMPLETED** - SDK research complete with bug fixes implemented

## Implementation Details
- Evaluated 3 viable SDK options
- Selected go-atlassian as primary SDK
- Discovered and fixed critical SDK bug (Filter method broken)
- Implemented direct HTTP workaround for broken functionality
- Documented findings in SDK_FIX_DOCUMENTATION.md
- Filed upstream issue #387 with maintainers
